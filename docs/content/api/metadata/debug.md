# Metadata "debug"

The `debug` metadata print detailed information of an action and its children. It provides a quick and convenient solution to understand the various actions called, what they do, and in which order.

* One of
  * Type: `boolean`
  * Type: `string`
    Values: `stderr` or `stdout`
  * Type: instance of `stream.Writable`
* Default: `false`

When activated with the value `true`, information is printed to the standard error output (`stderr`).

The information generated by the `debug` metadata is similar to the output of the [logging](/current/guide/loging_debugging/) facilities. So when shall debugging be used versus logging? The `debug` metadata is for developers who wish to punctually see on their shell what going on inside. The logging facilities are meant to be constantly activated.

## Usage

### Activating debugging

Activating debugging is easy, simply pass the `debug` metadata with a value set as `true`:

```js
nikita
.file.touch({
  // highlight-next-line
  $debug: true
  target: '/tmp/a_file'
})
```

Of course, it is possible to activate debugging to the overall Nikita session by passing the metadata globally at session creation:

```js
nikita({
  // highlight-next-line
  $debug: true
})
.file.touch({
  target: '/tmp/a_file'
})
```

### Redirecting output to stdout

Set the value to `stdout` if you wish to print debugging information to the standard output (stdout):

```js
nikita
.file.touch({
  // highlight-next-line
  $debug: 'stdout',
  target: '/tmp/a_file'
})
```
